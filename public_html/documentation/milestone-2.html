    <h2>This will be the front page of my clothing line website.</h2>

    <h3>Header and Footer</h3>
    <p>There will be navbar in the header to jump to the desired content. The web view will feature a link bar and
        social media links at the bottom of the page.
        The footer will remain in place while the user scrolls in mobile view.</p>

    <h3>Welcome/About</h3>
    <p>The home landing page will feature the store name with an image background of something music
        festival/concert/some live music event related along with an About section. The about section will cover how I
        came up with the idea (the problem that needs solving), whom the problem affects, and how I am working to fix
        this problem. This section will include images of the security features (sort of... those are currently trade
        secrets) as well. </p>

    <h3>Shop</h3>
    <p>The shop portion will feature a minimalist layout in order to keep the focus on the product images. Under each
        image will be a brief description of the features used, the artist collaborated with(if any),
        and the price.</p>

    <h3>Collaborate</h3>
    <p>The collaborate section will give artists, suppliers, influencers, and anyone else who wants to collaborate as well as
        idea of how we operate, list our values, and show images of current and/or prior projects, suppliers, etc. There will be a link to the contact form embedded in the text. </p>

    <h3>Customize</h3>
    <p>The customize section will show what features, fabrics, and designs are available for customization as well as a
        link to the contact form to submit form to start the customization conversation. Hovering over the image will
        focus in on the image showing a larger version as well as a tooltip with a brief description of the feature </p>

    <h3>Contact</h3>
    <p>The contact form will serve as the first step in the user communication process regardless of reason. The radio
        buttons on the form will serve as switch-tracks guiding the email to the corresponding mailbox when the form is
        submitted. </p>
