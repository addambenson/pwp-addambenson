    <h2>Persona</h2>
    <h3>Name:</h3>
        <p>Jim Snipe</p>
    <h3>Age:</h3>
        <p>25</p>
    <h3>Profession</h3>
        <p>Traveling Nurse. He needs to be able to shop on the go with his phone and on his laptop during layovers, time off, and at home. Jim has a festival coming up and wants some new gear.</p>
    <h3>Technology</h3>
        Mac power user. Has a macbook pro running OS Monterey iPhone 13 Pro Max with unlimited 5G running iOS 15, an iPad Pro running iOS 15.2
    <h3>Attitudes and Behaviors</h3>
        Jim likes to let loose when he's not working. He loves live music and going to events alone or with his friends. He is an avid social media user, often chronicling his experiences through Instagram and Twitter.
    <h3>Frustrations and Needs</h3>
        The culture of large music events is, for the majority, a wonderful crowd. However, as with everything else, there are bad actors. The primary frustration is theft of personal valuables such as mobile devices, wallets, and keys. David has to always consider the possibility that someone could pick his pocket. This takes away from the experience. David needs pants or shorts that have security mechanisms built into the pockets, and/or hidden pockets available to store his valuables to keep them safe from thieves. The garment must also be fashionable as Jim likes to express himself through his outfits.
    <h3>Goals</h3>
        David is outfit shopping through the limited choices available to males. He only has so much time off to search for clothing. The site needs to pull him in immediately and showcase what the clothing line has to offer.
    <h3>User Story</h3>
        As a user/shopper, I need to find a pair of secure, fashionable shorts to ease my mind so I can enjoy myself more fully at my next event
