        <h3 class="text-center">Frustrations and Needs</h3>
        <div class="col-md-12">
            <p>The culture of large music events is, for the majority, a wonderful crowd. However, as with everything else, there are bad actors. The primary frustration is theft of personal valuables such as mobile devices, wallets, and keys. Jim has to always consider the possibility that someone could pick his pocket. This takes away from the experience. Jim needs pants or shorts that have security mechanisms built into the pockets, and/or hidden pockets available to store his valuables to keep them safe from thieves. The garment must also be fashionable as Jim likes to express himself through his outfits.</p>

        <div class="col-md-12">
            <p>Jim is outfit shopping through the limited choices available to males. He only has so much time off to search for clothing. The site needs to pull him in immediately and showcase what the clothing line has to offer. </p>
